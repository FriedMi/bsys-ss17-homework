# hw2

## Tasks
To fullfill **hw2** you have to solve:

- task1
- task2
- simu1

Optional are (bonus +1P):

- task3 (important: Rust idiomatic code please)

## Files
You find already `main.rs` and `output.bats` files for some rust tasks. Please remember to use cargo to create a new project for each task and copy the given files into their dedicated directories.

For task2 you have to restructure task1 and enhance it, therefore the tests were seperated into a new file, called `task2.rs`. Please copy this file also to `tests/`. At the end of task2 your directory structure should be:

```
hw0/task2
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── README.md
├── src
│   └── main.rs
│   └── lib.rs
└── tests
    └── output.bats
    └── task2.rs
```


## ASIDE: `simu1/` dir

In this homework it's not a simulation homework sitting in `simu1/` but some questions to have fun with buggy c-files. As not to interfer with rust code, questions, c-code and your answers should go into `simu1/`.

## Pull-Reuest

Please merge any accepted reviews into your branch. If you are ready with the homework, all tests run, please create a pull request named **hw2**.
