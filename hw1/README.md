## ASIDE: SIMULATION HOMEWORKS

Simulation homeworks (`simuN/`) come in the form of simulators you run to
make sure you understand some piece of the material. The simulators are generally python programs that enable you both to generate different problems (using different random seeds) as well as to have the program solve the problem for you (with the `-c` flag) so that you can check your answers. Running any simulator with a `-h` or `--help`flag will provide with more information as to all the options the simulator gives you.

The README provided with each simulator gives more detail as to how to run it. Each flag is described in some detail therein.

You find all Files for your simulation homework in the `simuN/` directory.

## Pull-Reuest

Please merge any accepted reviews into your branch. If you are ready with the homework, all tests run, please create a pull request named "hw1".
